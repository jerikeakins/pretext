  <p>
      Find a seat near other students! Work through all of the exercises as best you can and feel free to discuss your thoughts about the questions with some peers around you. Peer facilitators will be walking around the room (wearing name tags and/or blue T-shirts) to answer any questions you may have during the session. If needed, you can access a virtual copy of this packet at any time this semester via the QR code below.
